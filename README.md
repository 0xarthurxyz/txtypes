## Summary

Celo has support for all Ethereum transaction types (i.e. "100% Ethereum compatibility") 
and a single Celo transaction type.

-   **Security support** üü†: the transaction type is supported but not recommended for use
    because it might be deprecated in the future.
-   **Deprecated** üî¥: the transaction type is not supported and not recommended for use.

## Background

### Legacy transactions

Ethereum originally had one format for transactions (now called "legacy transactions"). 
A legacy transaction contains the following transaction parameters:
`nonce`, `gasPrice`, `gasLimit`, `recipient`, `amount`, `data`, and `chaindId`.

To produce a valid "legacy transaction":

1.  the **transaction parameters** are [RLP-encoded](https://eth.wiki/fundamentals/rlp): 

    ```
    RLP([nonce, gasprice, gaslimit, recipient, amount, data, chaindId, 0, 0])
    ```

1.  the RLP-encoded transaction is hashed (using Keccak256).

1.  the hash is signed with a private key using the ECDSA algorithm, which generates the `v`, `r`, 
    and `s` **signature parameters**.

1.  the transaction _and_ signature parameters above are RLP-encoded to produce a valid **signed 
    transaction**:

    ```
    RLP([nonce, gasprice, gaslimit, recipient, amount, data, v, r, s])
    ```

A valid signed transaction can then be submitted on-chain, and its raw parameters can be 
parsed by RLP-decoding the transaction.

### Typed transactions

Over time, the Ethereum community has sought to add new types of transactions 
such as dynamic fee transactions 
([EIP-1559: Fee market change for ETH 1.0 chain](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559)) 
or optional access list transactions 
([EIP-2930: Optional access lists](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930)) 
to supported new desired behaviors on the network.

To allow new transactions to be supported without breaking support with the 
legacy transaction format, the concept of **typed transactions** was proposed in 
[EIP-2718: Typed Transaction Envelope](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718), which introduces 
a new high-level transaction format that is used to implement all future transaction types.

### Distinguishing between legacy and typed transactions

Whereas a valid "legacy transaction" is simply an RLP-encoded list of 
**transaction parameters**, a valid "typed transactions" is an arbitrary byte array 
prepended with a **transaction type**, where:

-   a **transaction type**, is a number between 0 (`0x00`) and 127 (`0x7f`) representing 
    the type of the transaction, and

-   a **transaction payload**, is arbitrary byte data that encodes raw transaction parameters 
    is compliance with the specified transaction type.

To distinguish between legacy transactions and typed transactions at the client level, 
the EIP designers observed that the **first byte** of a legacy transaction would never be in the range 
`[0, 0x7f]` (or `[0, 127]`), and instead always be in the range `[0xc0, 0xfe]` (or `[192, 254]`). 

With that observation, transactions can be decoded with the following heuristic:

-   read the first byte of a transaction
-   if it's bigger than `0x7f` (`127`), then it's a **legacy transaction**. To decode it you, 
    must read _all_ bytes (including the first byte just read) and interpret them as a 
    legacy transaction.
-   else, if it's smaller or equal to `0x7f` (`127`), then it's a **typed transaction**. To decode
    it you must read the _remaining_ bytes (excluding the first byte just read) and interpret them
    according to the specified transaction type.

Every transaction type is defined in an EIP, which specifies how to _encode_ as well as _decode_ 
transaction payloads. This means that a typed transaction can only be interpreted with knowledge of 
its transaction type and a relevant decoder.

## Todos

-   [x] CHECK: That any valid typed or untyped Ethereum transaction is valid on Celo ?
    All transactions (legacy and newly typed Ethereum transactions) are valid on Celo

-   [x] CHECK: Does Celo support 0x00 typed Celo-specific transactions?
    Yes, there is no specific 0x00 typed transactions, legacy transactions are simply accepted and implied to be of type 0 (althought they are not prefixed with `0x00 || ...`)

-   [x] CHECK: Does Celo support access list with Celo-specific parameters
    No, Celo only supports accessList via EIP-1559 Ethereum transactions (type 0x02) and Celo dynamic fee v2 transactions (type 0x7b), there is no Celo-specific access list transaction type (with the legacy format, i.e. no max gas fee and Celo-specific parameters)

-   [x] CHECK: Does Celo support access list with legacy gasLimit field instead of EIP-1559
    Yes, Celo supports access list in Ethereum access list transcactions (i.e. with legacy gasLimit field instead of EIP-1559)

-   Demo all recommended and supported transaction types
    -   [ ] Celo CIP-64 transaction (the only Celo-specific transaction type recommended and supported long-term)
    -   [ ] Ethereum EIP-1559 transaction
    -   [ ] Ethereum access list transaction
    -   [ ] Ethereum legacy transaction

-   [ ] Specify that all Ethereum transactions are valid on Celo

-   [ ] Consider using "Active Support" and	"Security Support" terminology for the deprecation warnings (like here [endoflife.date/nodejs](https://endoflife.date/nodejs))
